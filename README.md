# go-tinydate
A tiny date object in Go. Tinydate uses **4 bytes** of memory vs the **24 bytes** of a standard time.Time{}

A tinydate only has *day* precision. It has no knowledge of hours, minutes, seconds, or timezones.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
go get github.com/wagslane/go-tinydate
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    tinydate "github.com/wagslane/go-tinydate"
)

func main(){
    td, err := tinydate.New(2020, 04, 3)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
    }
    
    td = td.Add(time.Hour * 48)
    fmt.Println(td)
    // prints 2020-04-05
}
```

## Need Second Precision? Go-TinyTime 

I've had people ask why go-tinydate doesn't use unix time as the underlying data, rather than day-month-year. Day-month-year supports dates from year
`0` to year `65535`. Unix timestamps only supports dates from `1970` to `2106`. If you need more precision, take a look at [go-tinytime](https://github.com/wagslane/go-tinytime) which
uses `unix` time underneath and supports second precision.

## Why?

If you don't have resource constraints, then don't use tinydate! Use the standard [time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) pacakge.

go-tinydate works well in the following situations:

* You are working in embedded systems where memory is a luxury
* You are storing many dates and smaller memory footprint is desired
* You are 101% sure you don't need more than date precision

Example:

I needed to store many thousands of dates in memory in order to keep track of which IDs I had seen in the last *X* number of days. As such, I had a giant `map[int]time.Time`. Switching from `map[int]time.Time` to `map[int]tinydate.TinyDate` reduced my program's memory from an average ~1GB to ~200MB.

## API

Godoc: https://godoc.org/github.com/wagslane/go-tinydate

Tinydate mirrors the [time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) API for the most part. The only methods that are *not* included are the ones that makes no sense with only day precision, or without timezones apart from UTC.

## Formatting 

All formatting is done via the time.Time package's formatting capabilites, but anything besides date data will be zeroed out for obvious reasons.

## Transient Dependencies

None! And it will stay that way, except of course for the standard library.

Note: Currently the testify package is used **only** for testing, but that dependency will be removed in coming updates.
