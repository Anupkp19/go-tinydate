# go-tinydate
A tiny date object in Go. Tinydate uses **4 bytes** of memory vs the **24 bytes** of a standard time.Time{}

A tinydate only has *day* precision. It has no knowledge of hours, minutes, seconds, or timezones.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```golang
package main

import (
    tinydate "github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate"
)

func main(){
    td, err := tinydate.New(2020, 04, 3)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
    }
    
    td = td.Add(time.Hour * 48)
    fmt.Println(td)
    // prints 2020-04-05
}
```


## Why?

If you don't have resource constraints, then don't use tinydate! Use the standard [time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) pacakge.

go-tinydate works well in the following situations:

* You are working in embedded systems where memory is a luxury
* You are storing many dates and smaller memory footprint is desired
* You are 101% sure you don't need more than date precision

Example:

I needed to store many thousands of dates in memory in order to keep track of which IDs I had seen in the last *X* number of days. As such, I had a giant `map[int]time.Time`. Switching from `map[int]time.Time` to `map[int]tinydate.TinyDate` reduced my program's memory from an average ~1GB to ~200MB.

## API

Tinydate mirrors the [time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) API for the most part. The following are the only methods on the time.Time object that are *not* included on the tinydate.TinyDate object, because they make no sense without more than *day* precision

* [Clock()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Clock)
* [Hour()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Hour)
* [In(location)](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.In)
* [Local()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Local)
* [Location()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Location)
* [Minute()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Minute)
* [Nanosecond()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Nanosecond)
* [Round()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Round)
* [Second()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Second)
* [Truncate()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Truncate)
* [UTC()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.UTC)
* [Zone()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Zone)

## Formatting 

All formatting is done via the time.Time package's formatting capabilites, but anything besides date data will be zeroed out for obvious reasons.

## Transient Dependencies

None! Add it will stay that way, except of course for the standard library.

Note: Currently the testify package is used **only** for testing, but that dependency will be removed in coming updates.
